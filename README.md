What I have learned from these projects:
- setting up a virtual machine using VirtualBox
- assembling and running x86 code using NASM
- debugging x86 using gdb
- executing basic mathematical procedures
- shifts
- calling standard and user-defined C functions from x86
- using comparison and jump instructions to create a for-loop
- File I/O processes
